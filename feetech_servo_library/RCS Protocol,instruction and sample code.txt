RCS 指令协议

Commands are in ASCII format:

Character # (ASCII 35) is start of message.
Next is the servo ID (0 to 253).
Or 254 for broadcast:
Broadcast can be used with these commands(Servo position reference frame commands).
Next is the command (usually one letter), usually followed a number.
Then there are possible parameters (usually one letter), also followed by numbers.
Either <cr> (carriage return, ASCII 13), <nl> (new line, ASCII 10), or both will terminate the message.
Anything still in buffer when start of message (#) is received can be discarded (ex: incomplete or interrupted messages).
Escape character (ASCII 27) clears anything received so far.
Letters always use uppercase letters.
Space characters (ASCII 32) and tab characters (ASCII 9) are ignored anywhere in the message, even inside numeric values.
ex:  #1 P 1500 S 100 T 2000 <cr>

Responses will also be in ASCII format:

Character * (ASCII 42) is start of message.
Next is the servo ID (0 to 253).
Then is the response and values.
Both <cr> (carriage return, ASCII 13) and <nl> (new line, ASCII 10) are used to terminate the message.
Responses always use uppercase letters.
No spaces are included in response.
ex: *1P1500<cr>

RCS 指令

Absolute position command:
# ID P Value T Value <cr>
# (ASCII 35) is start of message.
ID 0-254.
P command followed by the position(specified in the number of position). 
Value of position 0~1023.
Optional T parameter, followed by time(specified in the number of milliseconds).
Value of time 0-65535.
ex: # 1 P 511 T 1000 <cr>

Enable torque output command:
# ID Value <cr>
# (ASCII 35) is start of message.
ID 0-254.
ID followed by the value L or H.
value L disable torque output.
value H enable torque output.
ex: # 1H <cr>

Query position QP command:
# 1 QP  <cr> 
If returns: *1P500  it is mean that the servo ID 1 current position is 500.

Query Current Runing Speed QT command:
# 1QT  <cr> 
If returns: *T100  it is mean that the the servo ID 1 current runing speed is 100.

Motion group G command:
# G Value <cr>
Value of motion group 0-254.
ex: # G 1 <cr>
Note: Motion group have stored in SCM-1 EPROM

# G Value ~ Value <cr>
Value of motion group 0-254.
ex: # G 1 ~ 3 <cr> 
It is mean that robot will to move motion gorup number 1,2 and 3.
Note: Motion group have stored in SCM-1 EPROM


# G Value , Value <cr>
Value of motion group 0-254.
ex: # G 1,3 <cr> 
It is mean that robot will to move motion gorup number 1 and 3.
Note: Motion group have stored in SCM-1 EPROM
